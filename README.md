Library of Infineon's highly sensitive [TLE5012B] 360° magnetic angle sensor(https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/sensor/magnetic-position-sensor/angle-sensor/tle5012b-e1000/) for Arduino.

## Summary
The [TLE5012B](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/sensor/magnetic-position-sensor/angle-sensor/tle5012b-e1000/) is a 360° angle sensor that detects the orientation of a magnetic field. This is achieved by measuring sine and cosine angle components with monolithic integrated Giant Magneto Resistance (iGMR) elements. These raw signals (sine and cosine) are digitally processed internally to calculate the angle orientation of the magnetic field (magnet). The TLE5012B is a pre-calibrated sensor. The calibration parameters are stored in laser fuses. At start-up the values of the fuses are written into flip-flops, where these values can be changed by the application-specific parameters. Further precision of the angle measurement over a wide temperature range and a long lifetime can be improved by enabling an optional internal autocalibration algorithm. Data communications are accomplished with a bi-directional Synchronous Serial Communication (SSC) that is SPI-compatible. The sensor configuration is stored in registers, which are accessible by the SSC interface. Additionally four other interfaces are available with the TLE5012B: Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) Protocol, Short-PWM-Code (SPC) Protocol, Hall Switch Mode (HSM) and Incremental Interface (IIF). These interfaces can be used in parallel with SSC or alone. Pre-configured sensor derivates with different interface settings are available.

## Hardware
Please find the datasheet of the TLE5012B [here](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-TLE5012B_Exxxx-DS-v02_01-EN.pdf?fileId=db3a304334fac4c601350f31c43c433f). It depends on the evaluation board which you are using or the respective configuration of the sensor on your PCB which communication protocol as well as addresses you need to use for communicating with the sensor. This library only works with the SPI compatible Synchronous Serial Communication (SSC) interface of the TLE5012B.

## Connection guide
To connect the 3-wire SSC interface to an Arduino with a 4-wire SPI interface you will need a resistor with a value between 3.3k Ohm and 10k Ohm. Connect the resistor between DATA and MOSI (pin 11 on an UNO). If you are connecting multiple sensors they can all share one DATA line and one resistor.

Refer to the reference for your specific Arduino to confirm these pin numbers for the SPI interface. Chip-select (CSQ) can use any available digital pin. Change the .begin() in the library examples to use your pin number.
